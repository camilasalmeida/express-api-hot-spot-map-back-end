## HotSpotMap App

The **HotSpotMap App** is a full-stack application with a robust backend architecture designed for optimal scalability and data integrity. Leveraging MongoDB for schema-defined persistent storage, the backend facilitates robust CRUD operations to manage spot metadata and guest associations. Authentication is secured using JWT, ensuring stateless session management across API endpoints. Nodemailer is integrated into the backend to dynamically construct and dispatch personalized email invitations, embedding contextualized data such as spot attributes, event schedules, and guest-specific parameters. This backend stack is engineered to provide efficient request handling, data consistency, and seamless integration, aligning with best practices for modern, scalable application development.
